      <p className="py-3">
        While I was finding myself in NYC, I took a break in 2021 and went home
        for the Jewish High Holy Days. I made the same kugel I make every year,
        except this time it was without the help of my mom. My brother, with
        much enthusiasm, said “This kugel is delicious, Robin, you need to sell
        this!” So, I am doing just that :)
      </p>
      <h1 className="py-3">Behind The Name</h1>
      <p className="py-3">
        The name "Kugelahs" came upon me all of a sudden, literally in my
        dreams, and I was set on that name ever since. It reflects my upbringing
        and what I want to convey through my kugels. Growing up in an Ashkenazi
        Jewish family, we always used the term of endearment, "bubelah." It’s a
        Yiddish word that translates to "sweetie." It creates a sense of
        nostalgia and warmth. I always knew when things were tough, my family
        called me bubelah and always ensured me that everything would be ok.
        Kugelahs was inspired by this feeling and word. My hope is that when
        someone sees the name and eats my kugel, they are immediately overcome
        with a sense of safety and feel at home.
